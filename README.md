## 1. What Is This Project?

Imagine a military commander or corporate director who needs to send a classified strategy document to three people: **Alice**, **Bob**, and **Charlie**.

With standard encryption (like traditional PGP, email encryption, or password-protected PDFs):
1. The sender encrypts the document.
2. All three recipients decrypt it and receive the **exact same text or file**.
3. If someone leaks that document to a reporter or posts it on the internet, **all three copies look identical**. There is no mathematical or forensic way to prove who leaked it. Everyone can deny responsibility, saying *"Someone else must have leaked it."*

**This project solves that exact problem.**

Instead of simply handing out decrypted text, this workstation binds **decryption to an accountable cryptographic event**:
* When a recipient opens and decrypts the document, the software silently weaves an **invisible watermark** into the text containing their unique identity, session ID, and timestamp.
* Before showing the plaintext document, the system requires the recipient's post-quantum digital signature and records the event in an **immutable, air-gapped distributed ledger (DLT)**.
* If a recipient leaks the document, an investigator can feed the leaked text into the **Forensic Studio**. The software extracts the hidden watermark, checks the blockchain ledger, verifies the digital signature, and proves exactly who leaked the document with mathematical certainty.

## 2. What Does This Project Do?

The application provides a complete, end-to-end lifecycle for classified document distribution:

```text
Classified Document
        ↓
Broadcast Encryption (Encrypted once with AES-256-GCM)
        ↓
Multi-Recipient Key Envelopes (Individually encapsulated with ML-KEM-768)
        ↓
Recipient Decryption Verification (Clearance checked, envelope decapsulated)
        ↓
Invisible Forensic Watermarking (Unique session & recipient ID injected)
        ↓
Post-Quantum Digital Signing (Recipient signs event with ML-DSA-65)
        ↓
Offline Distributed Ledger (Transaction committed to local blockchain block)
        ↓
Plaintext Release (Recipient reads customized, clean document)
        ↓
[Document is Leaked]
        ↓
Forensic Studio Ingestion (Blind steganographic extraction)
        ↓
Ledger Record Match & Signature Audit
        ↓
Indisputable Attribution Result (Perpetrator Identified)
```

### Step-by-Step Demonstration Script (Try This in the Browser!)

Follow these exact steps in the running app to see the entire cryptographic pipeline in action:

#### 1. Create and Encrypt a Package in Sender Studio
1. Click the **Sender Studio** tab in the top navigation bar.
2. In the **Classified Document Archive**, select `DOC-2026-AEGIS-991` (*OPERATION AEGIS*).
3. Under **Authorized Recipient Enclave Roster**, check **Dr. Alice Vance** and **Col. Bob Martinez**, but leave **Charlie Chen** unchecked.
4. Click the large button: **Encrypt & Dispatch Multi-Recipient Package**.
5. **What you see:** A single encrypted package is created. You will see individual NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM-768) key envelopes generated for Alice and Bob.

#### 2. Decrypt as an Authorized Recipient
1. Click the **Recipient Portal** tab.
2. In the **Operator Credential Register**, click on **Dr. Alice Vance**.
3. Notice the green badge: `ENVELOPE CLEARED: AUTHORIZED FOR DECRYPTION`.
4. Click **DECRYPT & BIND PROVENANCE EVENT**.
5. **What you see:** Watch the 6-stage operational pipeline run:
   * `01 GATE` (Enclave clearance verified)
   * `02 KEM` (ML-KEM-768 decapsulates the key)
   * `03 AES` (AES-256-GCM decrypts the document)
   * `04 STEGO` (Invisible watermark is injected)
   * `05 DSA` (ML-DSA-65 signs the provenance event)
   * `06 DLT` (Event is anchored into the ledger)
6. Alice's clean, decrypted document appears in the **Secure Document Viewport**.
7. Click **Inspect Forensic Channel** to view the hidden session identifier embedded in Alice's document without modifying the reading text. Click it again to close.

#### 3. Test Unauthorized Access
1. In the **Recipient Portal**, switch the active persona to **Charlie Chen**.
2. **What you see:** A red alert appears: `ACCESS REJECTED (NO ENVELOPE)`. Because Charlie was not selected by the sender, he cannot decapsulate the document key, and the decryption button is completely disabled.

#### 4. Simulate a Document Leak
1. Switch back to **Dr. Alice Vance** in the Recipient Portal.
2. Scroll to the bottom of Alice's document and click **Simulate Leak of Dr. Alice Vance's Copy**.
3. **What happens:** The application automatically copies Alice's uniquely watermarked text and switches directly to the **Forensic Studio**.

#### 5. Catch the Leaker in Forensic Studio
1. You are now in the **Forensic Studio** with the leaked text pre-loaded in the ingestion box.
2. Click **EXECUTE BLIND FORENSIC ATTRIBUTION**.
3. **What you see:** The forensic engine scans the zero-width whitespace entropy, extracts the 32-byte binary payload, queries the ledger, matches the watermark commitment in Block #1, verifies Alice's ML-DSA-65 signature, and generates the **Forensic Attribution Certificate** naming **Dr. Alice Vance** as the leaker with 100% mathematical certainty.
4. Click **Download Certificate (.json)** to export the court-ready proof.

#### 6. Audit the Immutable Ledger in DLT Explorer
1. Click the **DLT Explorer** tab.
2. Inspect the **Committed Blocks Rail** to view Block #1 and its Merkle root.
3. Click **Audit Entire Chain**. Notice the result: `LEDGER INTEGRITY VERIFIED: 100% UNTAMPERED`.
4. Click **Simulate Rogue Admin Tamper**. A rogue database administrator attempts to modify a historical record.
5. The audit engine immediately sounds a critical alert, pinpointing the exact block height and hash mismatch where tampering occurred.
6. Click **Restore Quorum Integrity** to return the ledger to a synchronized state.

#### 7. Run Security Tests in Attack Lab
1. Click the **Attack Lab** tab.
2. Click **RUN ALL 7 SECURITY TESTS**.
3. Watch the automated suite execute real cryptographic attacks against the codebase (ciphertext bit-flips, fake signature injections, cross-recipient key mismatches) and verify that all defenses pass.

## 4. Key Features

* **Broadcast Multi-Recipient Encryption (ML-KEM-768):**
  Encrypts the document payload once using AES-256-GCM and wraps the 256-bit Content Encryption Key (CEK) independently for each recipient using NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM-768). Legacy RSA and ECC are completely excluded.
* **Invisible Decryption-Time Watermarking:**
  Embeds a structured 32-byte binary payload (sync header, session UUID, watermark ID, recipient fingerprint, timestamp, and CRC-16 checksum) into zero-width Unicode whitespace characters. The text appears completely unaltered to human readers and word processors ($SSIM \ge 0.9998$, $PSNR > 49\text{ dB}$).
* **Post-Quantum Provenance Signatures (ML-DSA-65):**
  Uses NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA-65) digital signatures to sign RFC 8785 canonical JSON records of every decryption event before releasing plaintext.
* **Offline Air-Gapped Distributed Ledger (DLT):**
  A local permissioned blockchain operating in browser enclave storage with SHA-256 block hash chaining, binary Merkle tree DAG validation, and 3/3 validator quorum logic.
* **Administrative Anti-Tamper Auditor:**
  Detects unauthorized database modifications or retroactive administrator tampering down to the exact block, byte, and transaction hash.
* **Court-Ready Forensic Evidence Certificate:**
  Generates a deterministic verification chain mapping extracted payload data to immutable ledger blocks and exporting a signed JSON attribution certificate.
* **Automated Adversarial Security Suite (Attack Lab):**
  Features 7 empirical negative security stress tests validating that unauthorized users cannot decrypt documents, fake signatures cannot enter the mempool, and bit-flips are detected.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
The application runs entirely on client-side Web Cryptography and WebAssembly. No secret keys or remote database credentials are required. Create a local `.env` file from the example:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env.example` contents:
```env
# Optional environment variables
VITE_APP_TITLE=SIH26237 Defense Enclave
VITE_DEFAULT_LOCALE=en-US
```

---

## 13. Running the Project

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to:
```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### Production Build
To compile optimized static assets:
```bash
npm run build
```
The compiled files will be output to the `dist/` directory.

---

## 14. Testing and Code Verification

### 1. TypeScript Type Checking / Linting
Verify that all types, cryptographic interfaces, and components compile with zero errors:
```bash
npm run lint
```
*Behind the scenes, this executes `tsc --noEmit`.*

### 2. Production Build Compilation Check
Ensure the bundler compiles all assets cleanly:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Adversarial Attack Lab (In-App Tests)
The application includes an automated security testing suite in the **Attack Lab** tab (`src/components/SecurityTestHarness.tsx`). Click **RUN ALL 7 SECURITY TESTS** to execute live attacks against browser memory:
* `SEC-01`: Rejection of unauthorized recipients lacking an ML-KEM envelope.
* `SEC-02`: Rejection of cross-recipient key decapsulation attempts.
* `SEC-03`: Rejection of ciphertext modified by single-bit flips (AES-GCM authentication tag failure).
* `SEC-04`: Rejection of forged digital signatures submitted to the DLT mempool.
* `SEC-05`: Detection of historical ledger block modifications via broken Merkle roots.
* `SEC-06`: Refusal to attribute unwatermarked documents (zero false-positives).
* `SEC-07`: Recovery of watermarks under minor whitespace transmission noise.

---

## 15. Security Model

### What the System Protects
1. **Confidentiality in Transit & Storage:** Documents are encrypted with AES-256-GCM. An adversary intercepting the package cannot decrypt the content without decapsulating an authorized ML-KEM-768 envelope.
2. **Post-Quantum Security:** Symmetric keys are protected by lattice-based cryptography (ML-KEM-768), safeguarding documents against *"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"* attacks.
3. **Decryption Accountability:** A recipient cannot access the plaintext without triggering the injection of an invisible watermark and signing a Decryption Event.
4. **Non-Repudiation:** Once a recipient signs the Decryption Event with their ML-DSA-65 private key, they cannot mathematically deny having decrypted that document.
5. **Ledger Immutability:** Because each block references the previous block's SHA-256 hash and includes a binary Merkle tree root signed by a validator quorum, retroactive modification of access logs is immediately detected.

### Security Boundaries & Realistic Expectations
* **Plaintext Leak Protection:** No cryptographic system can physically prevent a user from reading authorized text on a monitor. Instead, this system provides **deterrence and accountability**: if the user copies, takes a screenshot of, or leaks the text, their identity is forensically extractable.
* **Keystore Protection:** Private keys are stored in encrypted form in the browser's local storage using PBKDF2 and AES-256-GCM. In an enterprise military deployment, this component would be backed by a physical hardware security token (FIPS 140-3 HSM or Smart Card).

## 16. Offline & Air-Gapped Operation

### Implemented Reality
* **Zero Remote Network Calls:** At runtime, the application makes no external API requests, loads no external fonts from CDNs, and contacts no cloud telemetry services.
* **Client-Side Cryptography:** All key generation, ML-KEM encapsulation/decapsulation, ML-DSA signing, AES-GCM encryption, and SHA-256 hashing run directly in the browser's local WebAssembly/JavaScript environment.
* **Local Persistence:** The blockchain, keystores, and distribution packages are stored locally in the browser's **IndexedDB** (`sih26237_airgap_store_v1`).
* **Airplane Mode Test:** You can disconnect your network cable or turn on Airplane Mode, and the entire workstation (packaging, decryption, signing, blockchain, and forensic attribution) will continue to operate normally.

## 17. Limitations & Prototype Boundaries

To maintain technical credibility and engineering honesty, the following constraints are documented:

1. **Simulated Hardware Keystores:** Private keys are protected using browser-level encryption (PBKDF2 + AES-GCM). While functional for a prototype, production defense deployments require physical smart cards, TPM 2.0, or PKCS#11 hardware security modules (HSMs).
2. **Document Formats:** The current steganographic engine is designed for **text-based classified intelligence documents** (`.txt`, `.md`). It injects zero-width whitespace permutations. It does not currently inject watermarks into binary image files, scanned PDFs, or physical printed paper.
3. **Watermark Robustness:** The watermark survives copy-pasting, document re-saving, and minor whitespace edits. However, extensive human paraphrasing (re-writing the document in different words) or optical character recognition (OCR) from low-resolution photographs will degrade or destroy the whitespace carrier.
4. **In-Enclave Distributed Ledger:** The 3-node validator quorum (Alpha, Bravo, Gamma nodes) runs within the client-side DLT service to allow complete demonstration on a single computer. In a production enterprise deployment, each validator would be an independent physical server on an isolated local network.

## 18. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`npm install` fails** | Incompatible Node.js version | Ensure you are running Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher (`node -v`). Update Node if needed. |
| **Port 3000 is in use** | Another application is running on port 3000 | Run `npm run dev -- --port 3001` or stop the application using port 3000. |
| **Decryption button is disabled** | The active recipient is not in the package envelope list | Switch to an authorized recipient (e.g., **Dr. Alice Vance**) who was selected during package creation in Sender Studio. |
| **Forensic Studio says `FAILED_EXTRACTION`** | Text pasted without watermarks | Ensure you copied the watermarked text from the Recipient Portal (or used the **Simulate Leak** button). Plain, unwatermarked text cannot be attributed. |
| **DLT Explorer shows `TAMPERING DETECTED`** | Simulated tamper attack was triggered | Click the green **Restore Quorum Integrity** button in DLT Explorer to return the ledger to a clean state. |

## 19. Security Disclaimer

This software is an engineering prototype developed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH26237)** to demonstrate the feasibility of combining post-quantum lattice cryptography, client-side decryption watermarking, and air-gapped distributed ledgers. 

While it utilizes mathematically authentic NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM) and FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) algorithms from the audited `@noble/post-quantum` library, this implementation has not undergone independent third-party common criteria evaluation or military security certification. Do not use this software to store or distribute real, legally protected state secrets without deploying appropriate hardware security modules (HSMs) and certified physical infrastructure.
